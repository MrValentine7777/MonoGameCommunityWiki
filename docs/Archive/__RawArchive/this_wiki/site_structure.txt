====== Site Structure ======

This page should help get you started on formatting your posts.

Visit [[members:mrvalentine:mrvalentine|my page]] and click view pagesource on the right to see how I structure my folders and pages. It should help you understand how to keep things organised, also check the links on the [[:start|home page]], pagesource too.

So far I [[members:mrvalentine:mrvalentine|MrValentine]] have utilised:

===== Headings =====

To create the TOC [Table Of Contents] list at the top of a page, use six '=' in a row with a space then the title of the page, followed by a space and then another six '=' signs.

==== Sub Headings ====

To utilise a hierarchy structure in the list, play with the number of '=' signs, you want to use less than 6 and more than 3 to show up on the TOC list.

When you have a few headings correctly formatted, it should create the TOC automagically.

===== Site Structure =====

Some side notes.

To simplify the entire site, for now, I have opted to use a single namespace, this means the sitemap will become gigantic one day but it is a small issue for now, So, please refrain from utilising namespaces.

Looking into setting up and redoing all existing pages to utilise namespaces. Complete.

==== If Green ====

Not much more to do, unless you aim to add more content to the page that is linked.

==== If Red ====

Click the red text to create the new page, this will take you to a page saying the topic does not yet exist, you can then begin editing the page to create it. Remember to save!

===== Remember To Preview =====

Remember to hit the preview button before saving, and if you can, type a short explanation of the changes you have made, no clue how the minor changes works, I think it adds the changes to the last major edit.

===== Adding Images ======

There is a gallery service behind the wiki, I  --- //[[members:mrvalentine:MrValentine]] 2023/07/28 19:29// am still investigating how to implement this, will update as I test, will likely look into it past this weekend..


For now, Please use your allocated folders in the upload page on the Media Manager page. Check the Wiki documentation to learn how to utilise the structure. I  --- //[[members:Admin]] 2023/08/17 23:06// may manually add content to the back-end service to streamline the service.

I noticed animated gifs fail to animate if you specify a "?50" trailing dimension scale, should you require the use of an animated gif with scaling, let me know through any means you have to contact me.  --- //[[members:mrvalentine:MrValentine]] 2023/08/17 23:34//
===== Adding Code ======

You can add code with syntax highlighting and allow downloading, click [[https://monogamecommunity.wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:syntax#code_blocks|here]] to see how.

===== ADDMORE: Doing Things Later =====

When you need to add something later, add a TODO: section to the page so you can search for it on the page or across the site to return to it later.

Use the following style to add one:

[ADDMORE: Come back here to add something later]

Initially I wanted to use TODO: However this is used in code a lot, so to reduce results which include code blocks, I changed this to ADDMORE:.
===== The PlayGround =====

You can practice on the [[playground:playground|PlayGround]] page to experiment with using the syntax for the wiki without ruining your pages history records.

===== PRISM =====

Read more about the [[this wiki:Prism Settings|syntax highlighting]] options available to make use of on this site.

===== More To Come =====

I will update this page as time goes on.

====== Game Jam Manual ======

Welcome to The MonoGame Community Wiki Game Jam Manual page, take a breath, where you can download at present the early preview of the manual in the 001 release state.

It is not complete at present, the aim is to gather community input and feedback to expand the manual, the aim is 64 pages, with the cover and back page as extras totalling 66 pages.

Please note 001 is an early unpolished release, it would help a lot if you could provide feedback over on the MonoGame Discord Forum thread.

__Remember, this manual is for someone who is a complete beginner and is just getting to grips in the game dev world, seasoned professionals may not gain any value from this.__

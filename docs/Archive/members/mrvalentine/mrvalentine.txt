Here you will find my contributions laid out in a collection of specific fields such as [[monogame:Base Code|Base Code]], [[monogame:Graphics|Graphics]], [[monogame:Sound|Sound]], [[monogame:Input|Input]], etc..


====== Stepping Back ======

So, I think I have stepped down from gamedev officially.

But I will continue to support this community with the Wiki for as long as I can, I have given the project a 10 year lifespan, costs a lot but got to have a pet project right?

It is currently around  half a year into its lifespan so, yeah, for as long as MonoGame is a thing, I will try to keep up, and keep information compacted and readily available for all to use.

I have finally started recovering from the recent sick spell, and now I have to get something going IRL.

If you are unaware the wiki can be found here:

https://monogamecommunity.wiki/

I will try to continue the magazine - something which takes immense amounts of time - but could be worth it.

Happy Coding. :sake: :xna: :monogame: :pizza:

===== Mini Blog =====

So that things don't get static on here, I decided to start a mini blog... just to update on my happenings concerning code and MonoGame...

[[members:mrvalentine:mini_blog|Click Here]] to see the blog.
===== What is MonoGame in my own words =====

To me, [[monogame:MonoGame|MonoGame]] is a tool, much like bricks and timber used to build a house, a framework on which to construct upon, want a floor? add some beams, want a roof? add some slate tiles.

The primary focus here is [[monogame:MonoGame|MonoGame]] as a Game Engine Framework, not to be confused with a Game Engine perse.

You are required to gain basic knowledge of the [[monogame:Base Code|base code]] and build from there. Want [[monogame:Sound|Sound]]? add [[monogame:Music|music]] and [[monogame:Sound Effects|sound effects]] as and how you please, want to utilise an external tool such as [[FMOD|FMOD]]? Want a [[monogame:Sprites|Sprite]]? [[monogame:Load Content|Load]] one. You get the idea.

===== What is this whole site about? =====

As the [[:start|start page]] likely states, I have always needed somewhere that was just a one stop shop for all my [[inside jokes:GOTO|GOTO]] needs concerning coding with MonoGame. I would always spend more time hunting for that piece of code that did that one obscure thing, and then have to hunt further to fully understand the implementation. I aim to put a stop to that time wasting and collate all my knowledge here, and others are welcome to do the same.

===== How can you contribute? =====

Please, should you wish to contribute, join up and then use the [[this wiki:Contribute|request permission page]] to be added to a [[members:creators_list|creators list]].

===== Let's Talk About MonoGame =====

==== Setting Up MonoGame ====

Follow the guide on the [[monogame:setting_up_monogame|Setting Up MonoGame]] page.

==== Anatomy of MonoGame Base Code ====

Visit the [[monogame:base_code|Base Code]] page for the Anatomy of MonoGame.

===== You should know =====

I am new to all this so do expect some inconsistencies here and there. I will do my best to spend time to reformat things over time, however, one day it will just become impossible.

I meant this wiki, I am still figuring out structure, trying to work it out early, as any changes down the line break a huge quantity of pages...

======  Tutorials ======

I will add my tutorials here as well as on the [[monogame:Global Tutorials|Global Tutorials]] list page.

I have decided to create a sub folder for my tutorials here:

===== Recommended Reading =====

==== Books ====

THE C# PLAYER'S GUIDE | RB Whitaker | https://csharpplayersguide.com/ |
While not specifically MonoGame/XNA related, this is essential reading for any game dev using C# and XNA/MonoGame.

Come back often for updates.

====== Stepping Back ======

So, I think I have stepped down from gamedev officially.

But I will continue to support this community with the Wiki for as long as I can, I have given the project a 10 year lifespan, costs a lot but got to have a pet project right?

It is currently around  half a year into its lifespan so, yeah, for as long as MonoGame is a thing, I will try to keep up, and keep information compacted and readily available for all to use.

I have finally started recovering from the recent sick spell, and now I have to get something going IRL.

If you are unaware the wiki can be found here:

http://monogamecommunity.wiki/

I will try to continue the magazine - something which takes immense amounts of time - but could be worth it.

Happy Coding. :sake: :xna: :monogame: :pizza:

[GitHub Update, am sort of back to coding, we shall see what comes of it.]

===== Mini Blog =====

So that things don't get static on here, I decided to start a mini blog... just to update on my happenings concerning code and MonoGame...
[Click Here](mini_blog.md) to see the blog.

===== What is MonoGame in my own words =====

To me, [MonoGame](../../monogame/monogame.md) is a tool, much like bricks and timber used to build a house, a framework on which to construct upon, want a floor? add some beams, want a roof? add some slate tiles.

The primary focus here is [MonoGame](../../monogame/monogame.md) as a Game Engine Framework, not to be confused with a Game Engine perse.

You are required to gain basic knowledge of the [Base Code](../../monogame/base_code.md) and build from there. Want Sound? Add music and sound effects as and how you please.

Want a Sprite? Load one. 

You get the idea.

===== What is this whole site about? =====

As the [Start Page](../../start.md) likely states, I have always needed somewhere that was just a one stop shop for all my GOTO [Inside Joke] needs concerning coding with MonoGame. I would always spend more time hunting for that piece of code that did that one obscure thing, and then have to hunt further to fully understand the implementation. I aim to put a stop to that time wasting and collate all my knowledge here, and others are welcome to do the same.

===== How can you contribute? =====

Please, should you wish to contribute, this is now on GitHub so just make a PR :).

===== Let's Talk About MonoGame =====

==== Setting Up MonoGame ====

Follow the guide on the https://www.monogame.net, I never got round to writing one on here, but might add one to the newer pages instead of this archived section.

==== Anatomy of MonoGame Base Code ====

Visit the [Base Code](../../monogame/base_code.md) page for the Anatomy of MonoGame.

===== You should know =====

I am new to all this so do expect some inconsistencies here and there. I will do my best to spend time to reformat things over time, however, one day it will just become impossible.

I meant this wiki, I am still figuring out structure, trying to work it out early, as any changes down the line break a huge quantity of pages...

Have since moved it to GitHub so it is somewhat more feasible to update.

===== Recommended Reading =====

==== Books ====

While not specifically MonoGame/XNA related, this is essential reading for any game dev using C# and XNA/MonoGame.

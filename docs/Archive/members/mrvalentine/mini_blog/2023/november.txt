Note: the latest post will be at the bottom.

===== Saturday 11th =====

So err, I almost did not get the time to write the third [[magazine:magazine|Magazine]] this month, but found the energy yesterday to get 12 pages done, admittedly 1 page is always already complete because it never changes for now... so I did 11 pages last night. on the 11th... I think.

That leaves 20 pages to go, six of which will be a deep dive on a game, and potentially another six on a second deep dive. Time will tell.

Just got to drum up some more code examples, and find some YouTube videos which will be helpful to readers.

More at 11.

===== Saturday 18th =====

I keep thinking to hit back on the Wiki and get some parts complete such as the Visual Studio setup guide, and also the core code a little bit more fleshed out.

But, I started a new project which will eat up some time.

More about that later today hopefully.

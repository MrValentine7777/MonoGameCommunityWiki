====== The Books ======

This page is here to help you find books which will help you on your MonoGame Journey.

They are in groups to show their core focus.

Unfortunately, some books were removed from Kindle, so, I have not included them here.

I only list books I have personally purchased a copy of.

A quick reminder, MonoGame is built on top of XNA 4.0, hence you should seek out XNA 4.0 related tutorials and books and they should work just fine.

I have added a list of third party [other community members] book recommendations below.

====== The U-MG-RL Links Archive ======

In no particular order the links are placed here for future sorting.

Original list: https://community.monogame.net/t/useful-monogame-related-links-u-mg-rl/8573?u=mrvalentine

Note: Some links have been filtered out from the original list either due to dead links or updated further down the list. I have taken the time to check the waybackmachine for the chance to recover dead links where possible.

====== The Entire List Directly From The Forum ======

I have opted to copy the entire list here, post by post, in a dedicated page, so that the information is here and I can tackle this list when bored.

Has been completed, 159 entries, around 300 links.

[The Archive List](the_archive_list.md) page.

====== Processed Links List ======

The reviewed and web archive processed links will appear here.
I will attempt to include descriptive information to enable easier searching in future.

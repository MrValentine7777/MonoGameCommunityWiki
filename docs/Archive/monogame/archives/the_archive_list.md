====== The Archive List ======

Below is the archive list of https://community.monogame.net/t/useful-monogame-related-links-u-mg-rl/8573

Remember to visit the [host](umgrl.md) page.

NOTE: Contributions from other users were not included here.

NOTE: If you are here before I filter these links, use the https://archive.org/web/ | Web Archive site to view dead links.

I have added Numerical values to the end of each 10 posts. So, clicking on 10 in the navigation takes you past the first 10 to the beginning of the next 10 entries.

I have also added numerical leadings to each entry for easier navigation.

It occurred to me that as some links may be dead, I should advise you use Application Guard, or something similar to load the links with, as dead link sites have a tendency to be overtaken by nefarious characters sometimes, that or just use in-private modes... be safe.

[A reminder to myself, I was watching the movie Gene Generation while filling this list out.]

Well to be honest I did not think the title would actually contain URL, only noticed it after typing it out haha

So I figured a lot of users - especially newcomers - ask for tutorials as someone did recently but that is not what sparked this thread, it was one of my now not so... just read the copied post below from my GCT post...

> While doing my now not so regular system backups and refreshes - though this one is called for - I came across a link in my favourites that was a bit too long for copying - though my account will back it up so I am not worried - and thought hmm interesting, it might interest people on here, so here you go...

So why not have a thread here which can both be useful as a central link reference so everyone can post any useful content here and also for people documenting MonoGame and dealing with the MonoGame documentation to find the best links to include in the documentation pages...

I believe I have started this off so when I find more I will add them here, as should you!

OOOH found another link in my favourites history

Go here

http://monogame.codeplex.com/

... and click where it says:
> [Change History (all pages)](http://monogame.codeplex.com/wikipage/history)

... and scroll to the bottom and work your way up, clicking Page links each time, then hit the back button or BackSpace key on your keyboard to go back and click the next link! notice that some have further links such as the Documentation pages, some good gems in those pages! worth a read!

For example, check out this list of games:

http://monogame.codeplex.com/wikipage?version=161

Which features handy YouTube video links too! XNA related but still relevant 

You can find some pages showing release history of various games too...

I highly recommend any serious coder who wants to utilise and learn how MonoGame has developed over the years to take a look!

Thanks for reading...

A handy link for users developing for UWP wishing to utilise the simulator and having issues getting it to work:

Side Note: Intel SGX is a form of Trusted Execution so disable it if you have that instead. disabling this allowed me to run the simulator.

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt228282.aspx#NoStart

The simulator is handy for many reasons, including creating Store screengrabs and playing with Location and rotation functionality and more...

EDIT

Side Note 2: A little confusing but to close the simulator properly, you have to sign out of it....... this makes me feel weird, but I just hit ALT+F4 and click OK to sign out and it closes properly ready for another smooth redeployment later on, otherwise it just gets all buggy...

EDIT

Started getting BSODs omg not seen those for like almost a decade  and will probably just I don't know... keep the Simulator for a rainy day I guess... as it crashes my system... badly... very disappointing really... used to work so well before...

EDIT

RE-ENABLED VT-d, will need to disable it to run the simulator...  SGX is disabled as I nor you will probably never use it...

EDIT

I should probably point out that the Simulator and Mobile Emulators are entirely different things, the Simulator uses your actual system whereas the Emulator is a Virtual Machine, so the Mobile Emulator works regardless of the features above... So logically thinking: the features that need to be disabled; these features isolate your system from a virtualised one, thus the Simulator will not function at all as it cannot access the host system.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5253042/encoding-video-files-for-xna

Quoting the answer comment here in case it goes 'missing'

> Windows Live Movie Maker can output video in the format desired by the video content importer in XNA. That is to say, WLMM saves video as Windows Media Video 9 "Main", using the VC-1 video codec and Windows Media Audio 9.2 audio codec. You still need to ensure that you don't go beyond the bounds of bit rate as specified [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd254869.aspx), but if you use the "Burn a DVD" settings when saving your movie, you should be just fine if you're doing 480p.
> 

> NB: I'm not sure if video without audio will save with an audio track. However, XNA's video importer requires that an audio track is included, or the import will fail. If I'm not mistaken, you should be able to create a second or two of silence as a WAV and include that in your video project, if so required.

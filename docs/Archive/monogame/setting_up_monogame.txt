======= Setting Up MonoGame =======

Below are guides to help you get started with [[monogame|MonoGame]].

Hopefully any Mac or Distro users can chime in and help guide setting up on each platform.

Additions to the Windows route, such as setting up Visual Studio Code, would be welcome, but please add a section for it.

====== The Windows Route ======

Setting up on Windows provides a straightforward method to set p MonoGame, I [[members:mrvalentine:mrvalentine|MrValentine]] have written several guides in the past on the official forum and will update and place them here.

Below you will find the information required to set up on a Windows 11/12 Computer.

===== Getting Visual Studio Community Edition =====

First things first, you need an editor environment and a common, -- if not recommended -- option is Visual Studio Community Edition -- which at the time of this writing -- is a free option for independent developers.

You can obtain Visual Studio from Microsoft directly here:

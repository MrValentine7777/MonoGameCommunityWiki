## Implementing Collision Detection

The following code shows how to implement collision detection in a MonoGame project:

This code snippet demonstrates how to implement collision detection in a MonoGame project. You can check for collisions between game objects by comparing their bounding boxes or shapes. By using methods like `Intersects` or `Contains`, you can detect when objects overlap and respond accordingly.

```csharp
protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)
{
	if (playerRect.Intersects(enemyRect))
	{
		// Handle collision
	}
	base.Update(gameTime);
}
```

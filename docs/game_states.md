# Game States

Game states are essential components of any game, allowing you to manage different phases of gameplay and user interaction. Each state handles specific game scenarios and can transition between one another based on game logic or user input.

## State Overview

The following enum defines the possible game states:

```csharp
public enum GameState
{
	MainMenu,
	Options,
	Playing,
	Paused,
	GameOver,
	Loading,
	Scores,
	Credits
}
```
Each state can have its own set of properties, methods, and logic to manage the game's behavior. For example, the `Playing` state may handle player input, update game objects, and render the game world. In contrast, the `MainMenu` state may display the main menu screen and handle user input to navigate the menu.

## State Management

To manage game states effectively, you can use a state machine that transitions between different states based on game events. The state machine can be implemented as a class that tracks the current state and handles state transitions.

Here's an example of a simple state machine implementation:

```csharp
public class StateMachine
{
	private GameState currentState;
	public void ChangeState(GameState newState)
	{
		currentState = newState;
	}
	public void Update()
	{
		switch (currentState)
		{
			case GameState.MainMenu:
				// Update main menu state
				break;
			case GameState.Options:
				// Update options state
				break;
			case GameState.Playing:
				// Update playing state
				break;
			case GameState.Paused:
				// Update paused state
				break;
			case GameState.GameOver:
				// Update game over state
				break;
			case GameState.Loading:
				// Update loading logic
				break;
			case GameState.Scores:
				// Update scores logic
				break;
			case GameState.Credits:
				// Update credits logic
				break;
			default:
				break;
		}
	}
}
```

In this example, the `StateMachine` class tracks the current game state and provides methods to change the state and update the current state. You can extend this implementation by adding more sophisticated state management features, such as state-specific initialization, cleanup, and transition logic.

### Some History

I initially began this project on my own services, which was expensive, and also, risky. I decided to move it to GitHub, where it can be maintained by the community, and also, be more accessible to everyone. I hope this project will be a success, and that it will help many people.

I will copy across the original files from the previous wiki and link the domain name to this repository in the coming weeks.

### Some Advisory

I utilise GitHub Copilot to help me write this wiki, take that into account when utilising any code here. I will try to make sure that the code is correct, but I am only human, and I can make mistakes.

The entire point of this Wiki is to help find answers and solutions and inspire you to create your own projects. I hope you find this Wiki helpful.

The Original date will be inserted here when I get around to sifting the wiki archive data.

### The Beauty Of This Being On GitHub

The beauty of this being on GitHub is that you can contribute to this Wiki. If you see something that is incorrect, or you have a better way of doing something, please feel free to contribute. I will review all contributions and merge them if they are fitting. It may be advisable to discuss adding a change on the Discord before committing time to the implementation scenario.
